The Brewery Pi project is a historian (for now) designed for craft brewers to allow them to quickly collect and visualize their brewing data enabling them to leverage it to help make better beer for all of us. Craft brewers operate on a tight budget, so Brewery Pi was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi (starting with the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B) allowing a craft brewery to get started with an investment around $60 USD for the necessary hardware.

Overlaying multiple batches by brand, for example, to check for consistency from batch to batch is simple.
